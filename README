NAME

MIME::Lite::Generator - generate email created with MIME::Lite chunk by chunk, in memory-efficient way

DESCRIPTION

MIME::Lite is a good tool to generate emails. It efficiently works
with attachments without reading whole file into memory. But the
only way to get generated email in memory-efficient way is to call
print method. print is good enough to write content to the files or
other blocking handles. But what if we want to write content to
non-blocking socket? print will fail when socket will become
non-writable. Or we may want to write inside some event loop.
MIME::Lite::Generator fixes this problem. Now we can generate email
chunk by chunk in small portions (< 4 kb each) and get result as a string.
